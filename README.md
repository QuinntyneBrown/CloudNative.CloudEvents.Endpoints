# CloudEvents Discovery Endpoints Helpers

[![Build Status](https://github.com/clemensv/CloudNative.CloudEvents.Endpoints/workflows/Build%20and%20Release/badge.svg)](https://github.com/OWNER/REPO/actions)


This assembly contains helper classes for code generated by the CloudEvents Discovery code generator that are obviously also useful 
without code generation. They implement a common interface for CloudEvents producers and consumers and include simple default 
implementations for HTTP, MQTT, and AMQP that can be overridden and extended if desired. 

**This is not an offical part of the CloudEvents C# SDK as it stands.**
