# CloudEvents Discovery Endpoints Helpers

This assembly contains helper classes for code generated by the CloudEvents Discovery code generator that are obviously also useful 
without code generation. They implement a common interface for CloudEvents producers and consumers and include simple default 
implementations for HTTP, MQTT, and AMQP that can be overridden and extended if desired. 

**This is not and offical part of the CloudEvents C# SDK as it stands.**
